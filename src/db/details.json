For 60 years, TMI has provided superior corporate trust services to church and nonprofit bond issues on behalf of individual bondholders. ↵↵In 2014, TMI was purchased by Reliance Financial Corporation whose subsidiary Reliance Trust Company's church and nonprofit services division is the nation's largest trustee for church and nonprofit bond issues. The two companies shared similar values that emphasize security, integrity, independence and a commitment to customer service that exceeds expectations. The two entities combined under the TMI brand, and the resulting company offers the most experienced and knowledgeable leadership and staff in the industry, with nearly 100 combined years of experience as a corporate trustee for church and nonprofit bond issues.",
